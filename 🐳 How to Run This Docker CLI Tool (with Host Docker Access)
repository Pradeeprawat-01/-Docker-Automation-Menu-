🐳 How to Run This Docker CLI Tool
After building or pulling the image from Docker Hub, you must allow the container to communicate with your host Docker engine.

✅ Correct Way to Run:
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock pradeep228/docker-menu
⚠️ Why Mount /var/run/docker.sock?
When you run this Python tool inside a Docker container, it needs to execute docker commands. But:

By default, Docker is not installed inside containers

Even if it was, containers can't control the host Docker engine

This causes errors like:

/bin/sh: 1: docker: not found
✅ Mounting the host Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) lets your container control Docker on the host machine — securely and efficiently.

🧠 TL;DR
Method	Status	Notes
docker run pradeep228/...	❌ Fails	Docker not found inside the container
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ...	✅
